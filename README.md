### Required Steps for Installation

1. Download the files
2. Move the theme folder to your **wp-content/themes/** folder
3. Be happy

### Suggested Customizations

On your admin page go to **Appearence > Customize** and:

1. Set your Title and Tagline
2. Set your favorite color to the links' color.
3. Send your logo or your pretty face in the header image

Although you can use widgets, depending on what you're using the sidebar's space may need some enhancements to looks nicely.

### Editing Follow Buttons

Crisp uses Font Awesome for icons. See the Font Awesome documentation for the [full list of icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and [usage tips](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/). 

I have placed some common buttons in **header.php** line **48-51**. Make sure to replace the `username` in the URLs so the links point to your profiles. 

### Adding Social Sharing Buttons

Crisp is prepared to recieve the awesome plugin **Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons**, you just need to go to **Plugins > Add New** in your admin page, and search for `rrssb`. Install, active and you're done.
